This is an unrealistic coffee shop website to pratice with, the UI design goes to my brother for credit. Please be aware I'm still working on this to improve my skills so I can learn more. At the moment I need to update this to make it responsive for mobile and other devices friendly. 

- This was done using HTML & CSS
- I will later add JavaScript
